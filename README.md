# Project name: "PersonalWebsite"

## Project Description

PersonalWebsite is a draft of a personal portfolio website that I am designing.
As with most first personal websites, it is to include content about the developer
but also the passion behind pursuing this career path and the idea behind the website.

This website was designed only using HTML & CSS and in the future I hope to add on
to its design with more complex ideas using Javascript too. It has a simple navigation bar, a 'hero' banner with a "Welcome!" tag and an "About me" section to show a little bit about me. I received lots of inspiration from other websites displaying personal portfolios and I wanted to make my first project similar to that.

Currently the website has no function and is designed to show a realistic representation on my current skill set and understanding of Web Developing. As the course continues, I hope to create, add and edit this website or any future websites with the new skills I aquire in this course.
